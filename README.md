# Code Refactor Starter Code

In this challenge I edited the HTML and CSS files to conform to the requested criteria. I restructured the HTML into sematic elements that follows a logical structure. I added alt attributes to meet accessability standards. I consolidated the elements of the CSS file and restrustured the order to match the HTML.
